Sliding window is good for use on things we iterate over sequencially
    - contiguous sequence of elements (elemts grouped together)
    - Strings, arrays, linked lists

Finding the min, max, Longest, Shortest, Contained within a given string, array, list
    - need to calculate


Questions: 
Fixed Length    
    - max sum subarray of size k 
Dynamic Variant 
    - find the smallest sum >= some value (S)
    - w/ auxilary datastructure (hashmap, hashset, additional array)

Longest substring w/ no more than k distinct characters 

String Permutations:
    - Does that second string exist as a permutation of the first
